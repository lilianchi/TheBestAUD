Tell me what is on the screen and I will get it back to you.

Sending me a * text note * is the best way to reach me.

My email account gets so much spam mail. So it's easy to miss a genuine email note. I have a budget phone. I have to check recent calls and then guess that someone maybe left me a voice mail message. And then call my phone number to see if the person who called actually left a message.

So if this is your phone, *** please send a text note. *** This is the only way I will see your note for sure.

I go to the Monroe County Public Library a few evenings a week, and that is an easy place to meet up.

98,Long-Lost Black and White Cat,"Greetings, Folks!

Different kind of post here- kind of a last effort (I actually ran a version of it last winter, and over the months on here as well. Have also posted in the various cats sections on FB, The Bosworth Block section, lostmykitty.com, and the local shelters as well.)

Just wonder if anyone has seen my little friend here in recent times (Butch)?

Long story short:

We sold our house to 2 good young guys, back in very-early November of 2018 (right near Bosworth & North Shore.) However, in the months prior, I would feed this little guy/give him drinks almost nightly- when it was warm out.

We left, I felt bad; so, posted about him, handed out many, many fliers over time- basically flooding the neighborhood (including individuals, small businesses, and postal carriers in the area). Then...

Lo & behold, he was seen twice! Once in early March, 2019; then again in mid May, 2019 (by some very nice men; one on the block north- 6700 N Ashland, one on the block south of 6500 N Bosworth). This positively confirmed to me that he made it through that harsh winter, 2 years back now  (smiles. And, since January of 2020, 2 additional men thought they MIGHT have seen him- near Sullivan High School.)

I believe he was ultimately a true feral; therefore, an elusive target. Medium build, with distinctive b & w markings- as shown (the face is almost an exact mix, half & half- but in vertical, not horizontal, fashion; exactly as shown here. And most of underside is white, while black on top. Look carefully at these images. And one who lives in the middle of 6500 N Greenview looks a lot like him too, plus another right near Farwell & Ashland! (But the former has the colors horizontal, as opposed to vertical, on his face.)  Could never figure out exactly where he came from; and I know a few in the neighborhood remembered him, from the time.

I would actually give supplies and, yes, $ reward to some nice person to feed him/give him drinks the way that I did. Sure, I know it's a long shot now.  But I'm hoping that at least, SOMEBODY in the area, or nearby areas, saw/knows something from over the months.

As one classic film reiterates... hope is a good thing (smiles).

Thank You!
Bob
(Update:  the nice manager at Clark/Devon Hardware, Jay, put it up on his poster board; as a result, I got a call from a man who MIGHT have seen him, but up near Lunt & Paulina.  But, this probably turned out to be the second one mentioned above- whom someone else identified as Chief.)    "

416,"Lost Cat, Reward Available","Our elderly angel, Simon (age 16), has been missing since Saturday, 10/23 around 9 pm. He was last seen at our home near Kingshighway and Sigel ave. in Princeton Heights. Simon is an indoor cat with grey, medium length fur and white markings on his paws, chest, and nose. Simon is scrawny due to old age and borderline hyperthyroidism. However, he still has a good appetite. Simon just started taking medications Friday, 10/22 for an eye infection and a bladder infection, so we are very concerned about his well-being. He was feeling much better on Saturday before he wandered off. This is very unlike him! Simon has only wandered off twice in 15 years. He was found under bushes/trees, so we are hoping he is hiding out nearby.  Simon is microchipped and we have updated his information with the Humane Society of Missouri and surrounding lost pet databases.

448,Found Parakeet,"I was at Metcalf's Grocery and saw a budgie in the parking lot. My significant other and I drove home to grab millet and a travel cage to try and catch it.  The budgie would not come near us, of course, and flew to different trees in the parking lot. Then a guy came up to us with millet and a big net and asked us if we were trying to catch the budgie.  We said yes.  The guy told us he had been trying to capture this budgie for the past month, usually spending 2 hours a day trying to rescue it.  He said on a few occasions one of his friends brought her caged budgies and they put an open cage with millet next to her caged budgies, hoping they could capture the budgie in this manner.  I guess that didn't work either. I'm worried this poor little guy is going to freeze to death, because every night the weather is below freezing.

It's a normal green variety living in the trees in the Metcalf's parking lot in Madison. No one was able to catch it.    "

450,you bought my jewelry years ago,"Wedding/Engagement ring
Waterfall necklace pendant white gold with diamonds in the center.
Opal and diamond pendant necklace. 

I was in the process of a divorce and didn't want to sell the jewelry but had to to make ends meet for me and the kids.  

The gentleman who bought them from me asked why I was selling them and spent quite a bit of time sharing his faith and encouraging me to not give up hope.  He said you never know what may happen and then said If I were to ever change my mind and want to buy the jewelry back, check with him and if he had it still he would sell it back to me.  

At the time I couldn't even imagine the what the next month would look like, let alone anticipate any sort of reconciliation that would make me want to buy the items back.  

I don't remember the gentleman's name,  and I know it's a long shot posting in hopes of him seeing this,  but I'm in a much better place in life right now and think I may be ready to put that ring back on.  

I have the original pictures I used to post the jewelry with and really hope it's not too late, you did hold onto the jewelry like you said you probably would, and are willing to sell it back to me.  It would mean a lot to me.  

I was not raised with a silver spoon and to me the jewelry wasn't just another piece of jewelry.  They were the only pieces I had ever owned that were real diamonds and white gold.  
I know they ate just things to some people but I'm a bit sentimental and it would make me so happy to bring them back home.    "

501,Huge list of shelters,"Below we have compiled a list of shelters and humane society phone numbers
along with some serious mistakes that people make when looking for their pets.
Make sure you SCROLL down, it's a huge list. First start by checking on facebook
Under: ""For the Love of Louie"" they cross post dogs that are lost and found.

MICHIGAN HUMANE SOCIETY: #1 COMMON MISTAKE:

THEY ALLOW CITIZENS TO POST LOST AND FOUND PETS ON THEIR WEB PAGE.
HOWEVER, WE HAVE MET PEOPLE THAT THOUGHT THOSE DOGS WERE SITTING
AT THE SHELTERS. MHS DOES NOT POST THE STRAYS THEY HAVE FOUND. YOU MUST
VISIT THE SHELTERS. THE PETS POSTED ON THEIR WEBSITE ARE FROM PRIVATE
CITIZENS THAT ARE HOLDING YOUR DOG.

AND THE HUMANE SOCIETY.

New info: Sterling Heights, Roseville, Eastpointe and Warren are taking some strays to a vet clinic in Sterling Heights to hold when the shelter gets to packed. Their number is  show contact info


GENESEE COUNTY HAS THE SAME COMMON MISTAKE. THERE ARE TWO
FACILITIES LOCATED THERE.

HUMANE SOCIETY OF GENESEE COUNTY  show contact info

UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE AGAIN MET PEOPLE WHO
DID NOT REALIZE THERE ARE TWO FACILITIES AND WEEKS
HAD GONE BY BEFORE THEY REALIZED THERE WAS ANOTHER
PLACE TO LOOK FOR THEIR PET.

LIVINGSTON COUNTY HUMANE SOCIETY HAS A WEBSITE THAT LISTS
THE STRAYS THAT ARE AT THEIR FACILITY. HOWEVER, THEY ALSO
HAVE A LOST AND FOUND SECTION ON THEIR WEBPAGE FOR PRIVATE
CITIZENS TO POST ANIMAL THEY HAVE LOST OR FOUND. YOU MUST
REALIZE THERE ARE TWO LINKS ON THEIR WEB PAGE. STRAYS WHICH ARE THE DOGS
AT THEIR FACILITY AND THE LOST AND FOUND LINK. IN ORDER TO SEE THE FOUND
DOGS YOU WILL NEED TO SCROLL THROUGH THE ENTIRE LIST OF LOST DOGS TO
GET TO THE BOTTON WHERE YOU FIND THE FOUND DOGS.

FOR A COMPLETE LIST OF MICHIGAN SHELTERS AND HUMANE
SOCIETY VISIT WWW.MYHUMANESOCIETY.COM

ANOTHER HUGE MISTAKE MADE IS THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE THAT
MANY SHELTERS WILL HAVE BOOKS WITH A LIST OF PRIVATE CITIZENS HOLDING
ON TO YOUR PET. THERE ARE ALSO BOOKS THAT HAVE A LIST OF DECEASED
PETS BROUGHT IN BY ANIMAL CONTROL. YOU MUST ASK EVERY SHELTER YOU VISIT
IF THEY HAVE A LIST COMPILED. GOOD LUCK AND PLEASE IF YOU GET YOUR
PET BACK, MICROCHIP THEM.
