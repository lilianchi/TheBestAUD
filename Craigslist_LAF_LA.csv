Items that got dirty from wet sand, I cleaned. Unprotected items that were destroyed by seawater while buried, I replaced with new items. All items are now in new Ziploc bags and protected by one large waterproof bag.

If you are missing such a bag and think, I found your belongings, please contact me and describe the bag's content. If the description matches, I will bring everything to you asap.

I am truly sorry for any distress I may have caused you - it was an honest mistake and I sincerely apologize.

I hope that you or someone you know will see this post or the flyer in the Sorrento Beach area. I've also contacted the Santa Monica Homeless Outreach in case you visit shelters.

Have you seen a large, fluffy-tailed, brown tabby cat with an orange noise and a very whiny meow? Maybe somewhere near north of Glendale near Glorietta Park? 

If so‚Ä¶ that may be Mochi!!

She has been missing since the night of October 31st, 2021. And hasn‚Äôt been seen since‚Ä¶
She had just turned 15 years old this September and has never left my side until that Halloween night‚Ä¶ and despite everything I have done to try to find her, none of it has worked. 

Please, if anyone has seen her‚Ä¶ maybe wandering around, in someone‚Äôs window, or maybe deceased‚Ä¶ please text me her PHOTO and I will be there in an instant. I am utterly heartbroken and I miss her so, so much. She is a biggo sweetheart, loves people and is very friendly, intelligent and loves to just be by you. And she loves boxes and will jump into one of any size, no matter how smol.

Please feed her, too, if you happened to run into any stray cats. They may be her, or they may be other kitties who are looking for their homes, too.

So if you see a cat that looks like her, please SNAP A PIC & TEXT it to me!!! Please help‚Ä¶ I really don‚Äôt know what else I can do. :( 

Thank you so much,

529,Orange male tabby,"This is Allie. He's been missing since 11/1.  We moved to the Norris Rd area by the airport from the coffee/Hageman area and he somehow managed to sneak out. Allie is a orange male tabby, almost 2 yrs old, very vocal, and he loves dogs. He has a creamy white on his chest and mouth and gold colored eyes.  He is a thin build, walks kind of stiff in his back legs, and can be grouchy sometimes.  He was bottle-fed and acts more like a dog than a cat. He is my best friend and I'm going crazy each minute that goes by and I can't find him.

571,MISSING CAT-MOUNT NEBO,"MISSING CAT, last seen 8:30am 12/4/2021

My cat is missing as of this morning. She is in the final stages of her life as she has cancer on her mouth, resulting in a pretty large bump on her small jaw. She has never left this long, and has been hesitant to go outside since her diagnosis. 

She has a clipped ear, is very small with large eyes, talkative, and her tongue sticks out the side of her mouth. She doesn't go far, and is probably hiding, so I'm asking for neighbors in the immediate area (Mount Nebo, American Drive) to check their shrubs and brush to see if she's there. She responds to kissing noises, and is friendly, however could be skittish, so please just email if you see her.

As mentioned, she is in the final stages of her life, and her disappearance is very traumatic for our family.
