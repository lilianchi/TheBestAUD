My German owl piegon escaped while I was on vacation.

Her name is Gerald.

She's likely nesting so I'll be reposting this ad for the next 3-6 weeks. Please keep an eye and ear out for me.

Color: white feathers with a tuff of feathers around her head, and grey wings with black tips.

Personality: she's domesticated. She'll approach a human if she needs for survival. She'll be quiet, shy, and curious but keep her distance. Will ""coo"" excessively if you get too close to her or her nest/territory.

Please update me if you have any sightings or know of anyone who found a strange looking dove like bird.

lost,"Greetings, Folks!

Different kind of post here- kind of a last effort (I actually ran a version of it last winter, and over the months on here as well. Have also posted in the various cats sections on FB, The Bosworth Block section, lostmykitty.com, and the local shelters as well.)

Just wonder if anyone has seen my little friend here in recent times (Butch)?

Long story short:

We sold our house to 2 good young guys, back in very-early November of 2018 (right near Bosworth & North Shore.) However, in the months prior, I would feed this little guy/give him drinks almost nightly- when it was warm out.

We left, I felt bad; so, posted about him, handed out many, many fliers over time- basically flooding the neighborhood (including individuals, small businesses, and postal carriers in the area). Then...

Lo & behold, he was seen twice! Once in early March, 2019; then again in mid May, 2019 (by some very nice men; one on the block north- 6700 N Ashland, one on the block south of 6500 N Bosworth). This positively confirmed to me that he made it through that harsh winter, 2 years back now  (smiles. And, since January of 2020, 2 additional men thought they MIGHT have seen him- near Sullivan High School.)

I believe he was ultimately a true feral; therefore, an elusive target. Medium build, with distinctive b & w markings- as shown (the face is almost an exact mix, half & half- but in vertical, not horizontal, fashion; exactly as shown here. And most of underside is white, while black on top. Look carefully at these images. And one who lives in the middle of 6500 N Greenview looks a lot like him too, plus another right near Farwell & Ashland! (But the former has the colors horizontal, as opposed to vertical, on his face.)  Could never figure out exactly where he came from; and I know a few in the neighborhood remembered him, from the time.

I would actually give supplies and, yes, $ reward to some nice person to feed him/give him drinks the way that I did. Sure, I know it's a long shot now.  But I'm hoping that at least, SOMEBODY in the area, or nearby areas, saw/knows something from over the months.

As one classic film reiterates... hope is a good thing (smiles).

Thank You!
Bob
(Update:  the nice manager at Clark/Devon Hardware, Jay, put it up on his poster board; as a result, I got a call from a man who MIGHT have seen him, but up near Lunt & Paulina.  But, this probably turned out to be the second one mentioned above- whom someone else identified as Chief.)    "

However, he still has a good appetite. Simon just started taking medications Friday, 10/22 for an eye infection and a bladder infection, so we are very concerned about his well-being. He was feeling much better on Saturday before he wandered off. This is very unlike him! Simon has only wandered off twice in 15 years.

We said yes.  The guy told us he had been trying to capture this budgie for the past month, usually spending 2 hours a day trying to rescue it.  He said on a few occasions one of his friends brought her caged budgies and they put an open cage with millet next to her caged budgies, hoping they could capture the budgie in this manner.  I guess that didn't work either. I'm worried this poor little guy is going to freeze to death, because every night the weather is below freezing.

lost,"Wedding/Engagement ring
Waterfall necklace pendant white gold with diamonds in the center.
Opal and diamond pendant necklace. 

I was in the process of a divorce and didn't want to sell the jewelry but had to to make ends meet for me and the kids.  

The gentleman who bought them from me asked why I was selling them and spent quite a bit of time sharing his faith and encouraging me to not give up hope.  He said you never know what may happen and then said If I were to ever change my mind and want to buy the jewelry back, check with him and if he had it still he would sell it back to me.  

At the time I couldn't even imagine the what the next month would look like, let alone anticipate any sort of reconciliation that would make me want to buy the items back.  

I don't remember the gentleman's name,  and I know it's a long shot posting in hopes of him seeing this,  but I'm in a much better place in life right now and think I may be ready to put that ring back on.  

I have the original pictures I used to post the jewelry with and really hope it's not too late, you did hold onto the jewelry like you said you probably would, and are willing to sell it back to me.  It would mean a lot to me.  

I was not raised with a silver spoon and to me the jewelry wasn't just another piece of jewelry.  They were the only pieces I had ever owned that were real diamonds and white gold.  
I know they ate just things to some people but I'm a bit sentimental and it would make me so happy to bring them back home.    "
